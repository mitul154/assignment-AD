# Title

Architecture Decisions for Retail Company Mobile App

## Status

Proposed

## Context

To improve consumer experience, the retail company is creating a new mobile application. Push alerts, order monitoring, loyalty programs, product browsing, and multilingual support are just a few of the capabilities that the app will provide. Support for offline modes, payment gateway integration, tracking of user behavior, image optimization, and localization are among the requirements.

## Decision

### Native, Web, or Hybrid App:

Native App: Offers the best performance and user experience but requires separate development for each platform (iOS and Android).

### UI Framework:

For a native app: Consider using SwiftUI for iOS and Jetpack Compose for Android.

### Backend Language:

Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), Ruby on Rails, and Java (Spring Boot).

### Permissions:

The app will need to request permissions for push notifications, internet access, and possibly location services (if the app includes features like store locators).

### Data Storage:

For offline mode support, a local database like SQLite or Realm can be used.

### Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks:

Payment Gateways: Stripe, PayPal, or Square.
